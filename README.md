# feedback-web-app
This program was a great way to introduce myself to React and advance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

The goal was to create a fully responsive web app that allows users to add, update, and delete feedback. I wanted to make an easy integrated piece so that I could add it to projects further down the line.

This project helped me understand how the React js Framework is organized. I would say the most exciting part of building this web app was learning about React. 

I learned a lot about how components are arranged in React, as well as styling and handling events. It was interesting to see how there were so many more accessible possibilities with the React framework. With every new component I added to my page, I learned more and more about this framework. It was very cool to see how easy it was to build certain things, like a reactive button or a popup with React. This project made me excited about the possibilities of Web development.
